Tests are written with Playwright (wrapped by CodeceptJS), extensive documentation can be found at https://codecept.io/helpers/Playwright/

To run a single test, use `--grep`:

```sh
yarn e2e --grep "Quickbar"
```

You can also run a single file:

```sh
yarn e2e tests/000-general.ts
```

Run all editor tests:

```sh
yarn e2e tests/4*.ts
```

You can run tests on firefox instead of chromium with

```sh
yarn e2e-firefox
```

The tests are written in `/tests`, the file names are setting the order of execution. The browser session is stored between tests, TypeScript is supported.

## Run tests against localhost build

If you want to run the tests against your local changes, first build the frontend and start it on localhost, then run the `e2e-localhost` command:

```sh
yarn build && yarn start
yarn e2e-localhost
```

## Run tests against staging

By default, the e2e tests are run against staging. Ensure this comment is set in the .env file.

`# FRONTEND_URL=https://staging.serlo.org`

Then, run the tests:

```sh
yarn e2e
```
