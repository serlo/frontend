## How we capture and process personal data

Serlo.org uses external providers for capturing and processing of the relevant personal data. In the following these external providers and the way of working will be identified and described.

### Processing of user data

#### Cookies

Our website may use so-called cookies. Cookies are little text files that are saved by your browser on your computer. Cookies don't do any damage to your computer and do not include viruses. We use cookies to make our services more user friendly, more effective and safer.

Most of the cookies we employ are so called “session cookies”. These are automatically deleted after the end of your visit. Other cookies stay on your device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.

You can adjust your browser so that you will be made aware of the placement of any cookies, will be able to allow or disable the placement of cookies individually, automatically disable all Cookies, or automatically delete all cookies at the end of your browser session. When cookies are disabled the functionality of this website may be restricted.

Cookies for the provision of the electronic communication-procedure or for the provision of certain desired functionalities are saved on basis of Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest in saving cookies lies in the facilitation of an error free technical delivery and the optimization of our services. If other cookies (for example cookies for the analysis of your browsing behaviour) are implemented, these will be treated separately in this privacy policy.

#### Server-log files

We as the provider of the websites collect and save automatically all information in the so called server-log files that your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:

- browser type and browser version
- operating system
- referrer URL
- hostname of the accessing device
- time of the server request
- IP address

There is no consolidation of this data with any other personal data we may hold on you.

The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest in the processing of server log files lies in the facilitation of an error-free technical delivery and optimization of our services.

#### Hotjar

This website uses the web-analysis tool [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/). Provider is the Hotjar Ltd., Level 2, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta, Europe. Hotjar uses so called “Cookies”, text files that are saved on your computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information thus gathered includes:

- IP address
- device type
- browser type/browser version
- your location (country only)

The information procured from the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a server of Hotjar in Ireland and saved there. Your IP address, that is transmitted from your browser, is pseudonymised and not consolidated with any other data of Hotjar. The collected data are saved in a user profile under a pseudonym that is not used, by either Hotjar or us, to identify single users. In addition, the processing activities by Hotjar are carried out on the basis of a data processing agreement with us. Hotjar is therefor contractually obliged to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation.

The analysis carried out by Hotjar includes the saving of cursor- and scroll-movements as well as clicks. Hotjar can also record how long your cursor remains stationary in a specific place. This allows us to create heat maps which help us identify website areas favoured by users. Furthermore, the analysis determines how long you stayed on a site and when you left it. It also allows us to determine at which point you stopped your input into a contact form. It is also possible to request direct feedback from website visitors via Hotjar.

You can always deactivate the tracking through Hotjar by following [these instructions](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out) (and thereby prevent the collection of the data relating to your use of the website, including your IP address, compiled by the cookie as well as prevent the processing of that data by Hotjar). An opt-out-cookie is then set, which prevents the future capturing of your data, when visiting this site. This cookie only applies to this browser and exclusively to the visit of our Website. In the case of the deletion of cookies it has to be set again.

You can find the privacy policy of Hotjar [here](https://www.hotjar.com/privacy).

The use of Hotjar is based on on Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest in the analysis of the use of the website lies in the facilitation of optimising our service.

This data is transmitted to servers of Google in the USA and saved there. The IP address transmitted from your browser is not merged with other data from Google.

This way, all collected data is completely anonymised. In exceptional cases, the full IP address may be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there.

This website uses the Google Analytics function “demographic characteristics”. With this, reports can be created that contain statements about age, gender and interests of website users. This data is generated based on interest-related ads from Google as well as from user data of third parties and cannot be allocated to any individual person. You can deactivate this function at all times through your ad settings in your Google account or disable by default the collection of your data through Google Analytics as described in the point „Objection to Data Collection”.

Google will use the information collected to evaluate on our behalf your use of serlo.org, to create reports about the website activity and render further services connected to the web and website activity to us.

Generally, Google will not make this information available to third parties. In some exceptional cases Google may pass on this information to third parties. These cases include i) with the consent of the website provider (us), ii) legal obligation or the protection of rights, property and/or safety of Google, its users or the public or iii) when required for Google to fulfill its obligations. As per point (iii), any third party involved is contractually obliged to process your data exclusively as instructed, in accordance with this privacy agreement and under application of adequate data protection and safety measures.

Google has signed a data processing agreement governed by the European General Data Protection Regulation with us and is fully compliant with the strictest standards of the German Data Protection Agency in its application of Google Analytics. Moreover, Google Analytics is certified under the EU-US Data Protection Agreement and thereby obliged to abide by EU data protection legislation.

This Cookie is effective only for this browser and the use of our website. In case of deletion of the Cookie this function will cease to work and you will need to reactivate the Cookie: [Disable Google Analytics](JS-GOOGLE-ANALYTICS-DEACTIVATE).
