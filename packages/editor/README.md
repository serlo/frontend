# Serlo Editor

This is an early beta version of the [Serlo Editor](https://de.serlo.org/editor). Be aware that we are currently working on this package and thus there will be breaking changes. The repository [serlo/serlo-editor-for-edusharing](https://github.com/serlo/serlo-editor-for-edusharing) shows how this package can be used.

## Releasing a new version to npm

Bump the version number in the package.json and
the github workflow seen inside `editor.yaml` will take care of the publishing.
